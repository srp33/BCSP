This folder contain any files that are needed for external machine-learning implementations that are written in C or C++.

ML-Flex is already designed to interface with the C5.0 Decision Trees software by Quinlan. This directory contains the necessary files (see https://github.com/srp33/ML-Flex) to run the GPL version of C5.0 Decision trees. To enable ML-Flex to interface with C5.0 Decision Trees, it is necessary to run the "compile" script that is in this directory. In order to run this script successfully, gcc and make must be installed and accessible. Some warnings will be printed to the screen, but those can be ignored. Note: This script was designed for UNIX-like environments, but it can be modified to work on Windows if necessary (please contact the mailing list for questions).
