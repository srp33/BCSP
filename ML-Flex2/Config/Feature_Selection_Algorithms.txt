# This file contains a line for each feature selection/ranking algorithm that can be used within ML-Flex. Each line has at least two entries: 1) a unique key to represent the algorithm and 2) a learner template key. The unique key is used within Experiment files to reference the specified algorithm. The learner template key references a value within Learner_Templates.txt so that ML-Flex knows how to invoke the algorithm. Most algorithms also contain a series of parameters that will be passed to the algorithm when it is invoked. These parameters are defined uniquely by each learner.
