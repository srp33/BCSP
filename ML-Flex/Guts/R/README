This folder contains any R (http://www.r-project.org) scripts that are either used directly by ML-Flex or that can be used to process the output from ML-Flex.

R contains various machine-learning algorithms that could be used from ML-Flex (for example, in the e1071 package), but so far it does not have a "Learner" class to interface with these. Please let the author know if this is a desired functionality for anyone.
